###**Description of the App**###
I will be working on an internally facing Wiki Application for "company unknown". The idea is that the company employees will be able to view and write articles inorder to inform their colleagues on their insignt on "unknown". Articles will be split into categories depending on what topic they are covering.This is a full stack application project which will be using many of the applications and technologies listed below:

###**User Stories**###
1. The user can **create** and **edit** articles.
2. The user can view all articles that currently exist.
3. The articles/posts will be **editable**. 
4. The articles will display an author.
5. The articles will display a time. If an article is changed, the time of that change should be shown.
6. The articles will be written in markdown.
7. A category can be added to an article so that articles can be organized.
